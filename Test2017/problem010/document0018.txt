In any case, it's not about the food or the cost. It's about belonging. I usually get together there with residents from the elderly people's unit near where I live and it's the same for them. The unit offers "sheltered" living, and the problem with sheltered living is just that â€“ it's sheltered. Old age can be a ghetto. We all need refreshment, to get out, to breathe fresh air, see fresh faces.
