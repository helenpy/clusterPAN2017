That figures. Just look at Friday's Guardian/ICM poll which found that 47% of respondents are "angry" with the political class and 25% chiefly "bored". Only 46% of 18- to-24-year-olds actually vote, many saying it makes no difference. Yet they are the same people who complain that oldies (76% of whom vote) are treated better than the young. How about a new word: Kidiots?
