John Sutherland’s 2004 biography of Spender was unusually engaging, but a book that acknowledged Natasha as almost “a co-author” could not tell the whole truth. When Sutherland and I edited Spender’s journals a few years later, we were encouraged by Matthew to include some controversial passages. Nonetheless, there were very few journal entries that addressed either Spender’s homosexuality or his response to the Encounter revelations.
