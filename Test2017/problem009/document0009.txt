New prescriptions were requested from the GP surgery, but they knew nothing of the hospital admission, and they had not received a discharge summary. The hospital was contacted, and the following day a discharge summary was faxed, but it did not indicate which medications had been stopped or changed. The junior doctor who had written the summary could not be found, and the weekend was upon us â€“ closed surgery, no prescriptions and a patient about to run out of essential medication.
