Ted provoked great love among many of his admirers, and particularly of course his friends. I met him with his second wife, Carol, many times and they were times of intense conversation, great laughter and some drink taken. He was an outstanding supporter of many writers he knew, including myself, and I remember times with Ted and Seamus Heaney where the deep warmth of their friendship was palpable.
