The voting figures for the last election show the huge gulf in democratic participation between old and young. Just 44% of 18-24-year-olds voted in the 2010 general election, according to Ipsos Mori, compared with 76% of over-65s. Contrast that with 1964, where turnout was almost identical among the youngest group – then aged 21-24 – of voters (76.4%) and the eldest (76.7%).
