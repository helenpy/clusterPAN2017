If the Scots vote yes to independence on 18 September, the Scottish government hopes that Independence Day will be on 24 March 2016, and that the first parliament of an independent Scotland will be elected on 5 May that year. It points out that the UK government has promised to "work together constructively in the light of the outcome, whatever it is". So, can independence be achieved in 18 months?
