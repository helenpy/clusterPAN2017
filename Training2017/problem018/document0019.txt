It is Moose who emerges as the truly tragic figure of the book. The title refers to the once promising diving career of a man now seriously out of shape. Soon after showing off to his daughter with a dive from the 10-metre board of the local pool, he suffers a minor heart attack. As he struggles to recover we learn of his break-up with a wife who found “she was married to a man who preferred to make a living out of falling into water. A man who was content to fall and fall.”
