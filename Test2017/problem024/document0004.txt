Reading the World begins with a self-hating slap (why are only 3% of books published in the US and UK translated works?) then wriggles towards a compromise (hey, we all have to choose what to read). Every contribution to the totality of interpretations is a good thing. I doubt I will ever read some things she has read – but I’m reminded of an Oxford don, who on being asked if he had read all the books in his study, replied: “Well, I know what’s in them.”
