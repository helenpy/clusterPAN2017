Those who know Pound’s work will find plenty here to enlarge their sense of the poet who promised to “make it new” and mostly did. Those who don’t will find that this book compels them to read on and discover him. They will be heartened, maybe even persuaded, by Pound’s claim, in “Canto 116”, that “it coheres all right even if my notes do not cohere”.
