The drudgery of this life, providing scant reward other than survival on the barest terms, is an exile from happiness that Zou, in particular, seeks to overcome. Even in despair she is driven by hope, a belief that at the end of each shift, or 20-mile hike from job to home, there might yet be something better. This is, in the end, a profoundly political book.
