Fortunately for plodders like me, itâ€™s not all pyrotechnics. The writing, never less than excellent, takes many tones throughout the 28 stories, some showy, some not. Pastiche, when present, is so skilful that it can go unnoticed. Subjects of real weight are handled with unobtrusive ease but never glibly nor diminished by facetiousness. There are even a few characters one can, surreptitiously, suffer with. None, however, to rejoice with. Happiness is not currently on the Mieville menu.
