Such a treatment requires formidable descriptive powers, which Wood possesses in spades. There are images so far beyond the commonplace they are startling in the truest sense: they provide little shocks within the prose. These are “sallow days, like something woollen left on the line too long”; particles of fog are “like tiny stitches in a blanket”. At every turn, Wood discards conventional imagery for something altogether more disquieting – a pond is “bilgy”, the sky “turns mirey”.
