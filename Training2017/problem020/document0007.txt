In a series of chatty and frank vignettes, the novel tells the story of Ali’s childhood in Iran, his emigration to America and subsequent career in an industry in which “career” is generally a shape imposed in restrospect on a succession of crises. Between shoestring tours, we find our hero waiting tables, working cash-in-hand in New York’s garment district and taking orders in a Dallas pancake restaurant.
