“I love talking: I do not think of what I am saying when I am talking; I do not think beforehand of what I shall say nor after of what I have said, and once it is over I would rather not see the result. I live from moment to moment … Plauderei [chat, gossip] is my natural medium, and whatever I know or think certainly enters it quite naturally, for better or for worse.”
