Good thing, say campaigners. And about time too: smoking has no place in a therapeutic setting. While I'm not going to argue with the science of this, it does seem regrettable that the same voices are seldom heard campaigning for other essential elements of the "therapeutic setting": decent, healthy food, for example, access to fresh air and exercise, talking therapies, even massage. None of which are provided on your average psychiatric ward.
