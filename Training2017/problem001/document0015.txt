I agree with that verdict and have done from day one of the House of Corbyn. Only Jeremy himself or the wider electorate can get rid of him. And, unlike the disconsolate Labour MP with whom I shared a train journey home last night, I don’t think bad results in May’s local and mayoral elections will be enough to bring down his house yet.
