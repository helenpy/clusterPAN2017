"Above all, I want to thank Sarah for her unwavering support as well as her love, and for her own service to our country," Brown said in conclusion. "I thank my sons John and Fraser for the love and joy they bring to our lives. And as I leave the second most important job I could ever hold, I cherish even more the first â€“ as a husband and father. Thank you and goodbye."
