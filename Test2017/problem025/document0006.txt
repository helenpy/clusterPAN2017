Speaking of Booker winners, Julian Barnes ’s The Noise of Time (Jonathan Cape), his first novel since 2011’s The Sense of an Ending, hits the shelves in January. It’s a reimagining of the life of Shostakovich, detailing the composer’s torturous relationship with the Soviet authorities. With hints of JM Coetzee’s The Master of Petersburg, it’s a story of carefully sculpted brilliance – don’t rule out another Booker appearance.
