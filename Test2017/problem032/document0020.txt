Ada is smudged in comparison rather than finely drawn, an elusive and wistful presence – but it is impossible not to feel her profound sadness as she fears she is heir to all her mother’s failings. It is through Ada that the reader gradually perceives the novel’s central theme: that of the persistence of memory, and the way that through remembrance comes the possibility of redemption.
