The family house on Bouton Road is a character itself – its veranda sheltering the story. It is introduced as having the “comfortably shabby air of a place whose inhabitants had long stopped seeing it”. And it is through the house that Tyler plays a trick with time in a bittersweet shift back into Abby’s youth and the house’s early days. We meet Abby’s upwardly mobile father-in-law, Junior, and Linnie, his devoted, apparently pitiable – but actually triumphantly tenacious – wife.
