As defence secretary, Dr Fox showed real commitment on Libya and Afghanistan, as well as genuine determination on transforming the MoD board, but ultimately it was his judgment that has been his undoing.

With so much at stake, and with our forces engaged on two fronts, it is untenable for the defence secretary to be distracted and unable to fulfil their public duties.
