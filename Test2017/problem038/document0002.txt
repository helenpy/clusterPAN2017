In the hands of another writer, this could have been a difficult maze of stories, characters and raw emotion. But Blume has worked on this for years and made it into the perfect jigsaw puzzle. Its only flaw is perhaps its greatest strength: how do you write fiction about facts that are stranger than fiction? Just like in life, there’s no great reveal and no childish pat answer. Blume’s fans – old and new – will approve.
