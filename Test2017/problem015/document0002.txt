While I was never a patient of the psychologist in question, I was assessed by him years ago for a new behavioural therapy service he was setting up. It was through this that the psychologist encountered the patient with whom he had an affair. He also admitted to a previous relationship with a patient and, according to the reports I read, police were investigating the files of seven other patients – three of whom had subsequently died – with whom he may have been sexually involved.
