There is no small question of actual romance haunting these letters. Marrs and Nolan rather stack the deck in this regard, as they provide interstitial commentary. But the bare facts are these: Welty and Macdonald saw each other in person only sparingly. They met for the first time, almost by happenstance, at New York’s Algonquin Hotel in the fall of 1971. Welty visited him in Santa Barbara three times. It’s not a lot on which to build a case for a serious love affair.
