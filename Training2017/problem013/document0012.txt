Finally, the far-fetched plots can be wearying. Most adults aren’t in the market for a story that brings together male strippers, incontinence and circus freaks (“Mister Elegant”); or one that depends on the premise that, if a boy were to contract every disease from every prostitute in town, the resulting warts would make his penis grow to be 8ft tall (“The Toad Prince”). These concoctions are hard to swallow but mercifully easy to forget.
