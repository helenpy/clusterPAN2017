In the middle of all this is the novel’s narrator, Claude Martingale, a French business analyst with a burning desire for anonymity who has fetched up in Ireland (his surname is itself the name of a complex financing model, in which you increase your risk when you lose, in the hope that you will win at some point in the future). But there’s a problem: he has attracted the attentions of “Paul”, a black-clad figure who eventually introduces himself as a writer in search of an everyman.
