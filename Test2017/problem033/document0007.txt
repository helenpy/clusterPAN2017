But 1599 is not the only high point in Shakespeare’s CV. 1610/11 ( The Winter’s Tale, Cymbeline and The Tempest ) is another. Before that sign-off, there’s 1605/06, famous for the gunpowder plot and its bloody aftermath, a moment when historical drama and dramatic history seem to compete with each other in extremes of threat, conspiracy and terror. This has become Shapiro’s latest subject, a darker sequel to his 1599.
