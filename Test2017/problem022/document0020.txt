The tension builds as Yasmin, Ruby in tow, commandeers a vast truck and attempts to drive the hundreds of miles to Deadhorse, and then Anaktue, along the Dalton Highway. She discovers that Anaktue was sitting on hundreds of thousands of barrels of shale oil, that it was a site of huge interest for fracking companies. She notices a pair of blue lights behind her on the icy road, which stop when she stops, go when she goes. Her fear mounts. And then a storm with hurricane-force winds rolls in.
