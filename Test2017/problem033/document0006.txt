But neither of the previous two novels nor this one reads as a dry history lesson. By making the narrative an ensemble piece – in Flood of Fire, four characters’ stories rotate and gently converge – and by an exuberantly ingenious hotchpotch of different languages and registers, Ghosh’s story roars along, constantly flipping between high seriousness and low humour. It is simultaneously wrong-footing and delightful, riveting and diverting.
