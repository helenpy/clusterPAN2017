Thus local councils have a new duty to promote peopleâ€™s wellbeing, a concept defined very broadly to include dignity, health and participation in work, education and training. Other new duties include provision of advice and information about care and support, development of the local care market, promotion of integrated services and meeting the needs of family carers. New services for carers are expected to be the main cost of the measures in 2015-16.
