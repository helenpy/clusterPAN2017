Peggy Frew’s critically acclaimed debut novel, House of Sticks was a moving tale of a young woman making the transition to motherhood which won the 2010 Victorian premier’s literary award for an unpublished manuscript. With her new book Hope Farm, Frew inverts the proposition, tackling the minefield of parenting but viewed through the eyes of a 13-year-old girl called Silver.
