I spluttered often while reading A Little Life – it is a book that teeters regularly over the abyss of ridicule. The friends’ successes are the absurd dreams of a teenager; the quality of the writing is decidedly mixed, with many an ugly sentence; it is a humourless novel, even when it tries to be funny.
