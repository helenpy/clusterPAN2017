Girl in the Dark is a memoir (written under a pen name) of those nine years. Jean-Dominique Bauby – who becomes a hero of Lyndsey’s – wove a poetic narrative out of his experience of being “locked in” to his paralysed body after a stroke. Lyndsey is still capable of speech and movement, but she is, in her own way, as trapped. She wonders, at one point, who is worse off – “whether to gain, as it were, the benefits of lights, I would trade the movement of my body”.
