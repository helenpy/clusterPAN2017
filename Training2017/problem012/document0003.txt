I’m not sure if my eagerness to get back to Scotty is akin to addiction, precisely. But it certainly suggests something of what one hears is the overall effect. When Scotty is telling you the story, every painful bit of reality he is describing becomes vibrant. So it is not hard to see why his (I’m just going to go ahead and presume a gender here) company is desirable in the agonising business we call surviving.
