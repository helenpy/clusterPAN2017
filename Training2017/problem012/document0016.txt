That doesn’t lend itself to much dramatic conflict. (Even the book’s resolution of Gonda’s fugitive status dribbles off.) Instead, most of the text is expended on the subject of Kay’s attractiveness. Those passages provide good opportunity for the sort of hilarious descriptions that have long provided fodder for close-readers of Randian prose. Kay is blessed, for example, with “a large mouth that looked like the mouth of an idol of an animal that had been sacred”. Sorry, what?
