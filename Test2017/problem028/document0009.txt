Once the Star Wars tie-ins (my favourite was Slave to the Empire: An Erotic Star Wars Adventure ) and novelty Christmas books for people who don’t read (remember A Simples Life: The Life and Times of Aleksandr Orlov? ) are safely remaindered, it’s time to look ahead to 2016’s fiction lineup. After a vintage 2015, next year has much to live up to, and the early signs are good, with a particularly fine-looking collection of debut novels on offer.
