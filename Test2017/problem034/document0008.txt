The last, long piece, “The Design”, has a characteristically inventive and unsettling subject, contrasting with the plain, clear, unhurried Stevensonian prose that it’s told in and the repressed emotion of the teller that finds voice only once. But my favourite of all these tales is “The Rules”, two and a half pages long. Read it. You won’t regret it, or forget it.
