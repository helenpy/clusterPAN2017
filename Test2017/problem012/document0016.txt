Exeter council, which pre-empted the DWP's bulletin and applied the exemption on its own initiative in December, says 31 out of 624 bedroom-tax cases are exempt â€“ about 5%. Nationally this suggests 26,000 claimants are exempt. Privately, councils have reported to me initial estimates ranging from 2% to 7.5%.
