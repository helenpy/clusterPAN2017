Harman’s sane, unshowy retelling is exactly right for the bicentenary next April. It never insults the reader’s intelligence by pretending that it has new, startling truths to impart. Instead it gathers up the best of what has been written before and deals tactfully and decisively with the sillier aspects of Bronte mythology. The result is a retooled classic biographical narrative, shipshape and serviceable for the next 200 years.
