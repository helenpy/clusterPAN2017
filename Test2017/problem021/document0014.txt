Yasmin has flown to Fairbanks with an ultimatum for her wildlife documentary-maker husband, Matt. He has been working for months in the Arctic night, has slipped, she thinks, into a relationship with an Inupiaq woman (“I kissed her because I missed you”). He comes home, or their marriage is over. She has brought their daughter with her; Ruby is 10 years old and completely deaf.
