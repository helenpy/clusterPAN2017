Our culture has become endemically dishonest. From top to bottom, from frontbench to back office, high court to low life, hedge fund to doorstep, duck house to tax haven, website to cold call, cheating has become the norm, and moral blindness is the new life skill. The scam, the sting, the blag, these are the credentials of contemporary social credit-rating. Deceit has become our default setting.
