One consequence of being born an aristocrat is that you think the written record matters. Your family, after all, has a paper trail that stretches back centuries, consisting of deeds, letters (legal and intimate), newspaper cuttings, estate books and diaries. What’s more, you’ve got the space to steward it carefully – a muniments room if you’re particularly grand, or a large safe if you’re simply making do with a cottage on the estate.
