This is not quite Boxing Helena (the much-slated film starring Sherilyn Fenn as a woman amputee confined to a box by Julian Sands as a psychopathic surgeon), but there is a fair amount of limb removal as sort of perverse retribution, with Robin – Strike’s assistant – being targeted as a way to get to Strike. There is plenty to dismay the squeamish, not least the chillingly graphic passages that depict the killer’s inner world. Suffice to say, he makes Voldemort look like the Dalai Lama.
