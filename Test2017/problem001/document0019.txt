The other death was that of a 10-year-old boy who had a heart condition that went undetected. He was an only child and his father, my husband's friend, had a very troubled childhood himself. He had pulled himself through and his son was his world. The grief has overwhelmed him. He cannot leave home as he is terrified someone will come and take his son's possessions. He is being paranoid, but his reaction gives an insight into his devastated state of mind.
