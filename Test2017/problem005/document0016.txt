By chance, I was at this time reviewing my energy charges, primarily at the behest of my daughter. I’d gone on these compare websites, which were great, except that I want bits of paper where I can cross refer, make notes, underline, just ruddy handle, but as she said, what I’d save on the electric, I’d use on printer ink. In the end I gave up; I might have saved a few quid but probably not.
