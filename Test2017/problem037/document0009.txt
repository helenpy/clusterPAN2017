The novel is not perfect. Hourston’s characters have an infuriating habit of speaking with the sentences broken. In the middle. Because. That’s how people talk. The tic is distracting, breaking the flow and the tension. Her unsatisfyingly tidy ending also disappoints, its pat reconciliations undermining a story whose power has lain in its complexity and ambivalence.
