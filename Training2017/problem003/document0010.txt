The genial literature buff John Hayes, the lifelong learning minister, is tipped for the chop by that shadowy Westminster figure, the Great Mentioner, who peddles gossip in reporters' ears at reshuffle time.

It is the minister's flowery way of promoting apprenticeships; not so much Swann's Way as Swan Hunters.
