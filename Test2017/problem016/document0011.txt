Another scheme, Homeshare, links up isolated, older adults with carefully vetted young people. Again, they are matched for compatability, and share housing, helping to meet each other's needs. Both schemes are funded by the charity, Shared Lives Plus, which receives most of its income from government grants, charitable trusts and membership fees.
