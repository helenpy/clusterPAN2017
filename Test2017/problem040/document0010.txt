This was the year David Mitchell (below left), one of our best novelists, fully came out as an SF geek. Mitchell’s complex and stimulating novels have always been heavily dosed with genre; his latest work, Slade House (Sceptre), a horror fantasia set in the same imaginative universe as The Bone Clocks, developed out of a short story first published as 280 tweets. It’s perhaps not major Mitchell, but any novel from this writer is big news.
