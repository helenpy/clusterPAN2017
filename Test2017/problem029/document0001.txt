Samson is a skilful storyteller. In The Kindness she has constructed a tantalisingly labyrinthine tale full of hints and feints, an intricate weave of tangled knots and dropped stitches from which, very slowly, the truth of the past begins to emerge. She plays cleverly with the timeline of the narrative, the vagueness of memory creating a slippery, uncertain chronology that obscures and occasionally confuses but never deliberately conceals. Samson is too scrupulous a plotter to cheat.
