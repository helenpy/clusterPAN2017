It seems what the government has in mind is the sort of model the developing world is trying to develop away from: namely, shantytowns on the outskirts of cities. You think I'm exaggerating? I hope I am. La Canada Real , to the south of Madrid, is Europe's largest slum. Home to 30,000 people, it is completely devoid of public services, including schools and sanitation. And it is just a 15-minute drive from the city centre.
