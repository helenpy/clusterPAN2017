I was 25 when I broke my neck. I completed my rehabilitation and ended up living with friends. But the arrangement broke down and I was left no alternative but to enter residential care as there was no support in the community back in the 1970s. I cherished my freedom so the thought of a residential home terrified me â€“ I thought of it as prison.
