Whether there is sufficient funding for this local administration is another matter. The outgoing coalition government has distributed a total of £470m for the reforms in the new financial year, which councils fear is not enough. Some £108m of the cash is to underwrite the new “deferred payment” scheme, by which councils will enable homeowners to postpone payment of long-term care costs until after their death, and so avoid selling their properties during their lifetime.
