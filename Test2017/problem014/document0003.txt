In England and Wales, it is still illegal for a doctor or loved one to assist a person to die. Lamb is trying to change that. He's taking up Tony Nicklinson's fight. The now late "locked-in syndrome" sufferer did the same last year. It's hard to remove the image of Nicklinson sobbing as he was told he had lost. There will always be people who want to die. Lamb may lose this week, but he will be replaced by another. Eventually, we're going to have to start listening to them.
