At Positron everyone is employed to serve a month as an inmate and a month as staff, turn and turn about. You get everything you want from life, but onchangeover day you go to jail and a couple you are never allowed to meet or know – your “alternates” – live in your beautiful home and eat off your nice plates. It’s a cross between hotdesking and taking in one another’s laundry for a living. No one has committed a crime, but everyone has somehow been rendered guilty.
