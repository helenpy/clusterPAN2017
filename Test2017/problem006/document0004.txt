Simulations by myself and former colleagues at the Institute for Fiscal Studies suggest that, had financial support merely risen with inflation, child poverty would have risen to around 4.3 million by 2010. Instead, our best guess (before figures for 2010/11 are released later this week) is that it fell from 3.4 million to 2.5 million children, or by slightly more than a quarter.
