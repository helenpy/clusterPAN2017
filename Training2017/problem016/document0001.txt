The book is divided up into broad subjects and trends: climate change, benefits, the rise of Ukip, the perils of social media. My initial response was a slight sneer. Did I really have to read British Politics for Dummies? This sentiment had crumbled to dust by page 33 when Edwards outlined a Liberal Democrat policy that I had never heard before. Clearly, I am a dummy; we all are.
