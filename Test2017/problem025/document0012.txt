One of Robert A Heinleinâ€™s better novels was his 1966 libertarian lunar utopia The Moon is a Harsh Mistress: this is rather more The Moon is a Ruthless Sociopath. It vividly dramatises just how deadly the lunar environment is. In a bravura opening scene, youngsters race naked across the lunar surface from airlock to airlock, in a kind of extremer-than-extreme-sports coming-of-age ritual. Its takes a great deal of hospitalisation and care to nurse the survivors back to health.
