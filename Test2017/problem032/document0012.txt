The plot follows Elspeth’s breakdown in the course of her two quests: the first in love, to find the undependable but authentic Jim after he goes missing; the second in art, to paint a mural featuring the ecliptic – the sun’s journey through the heavens as seen from Earth – and, as such, a chimera (since the sun doesn’t actually move).
