But what I hear today is a young woman singing through confusion. The songs range from the sad to the aggressive. Her lyrics are all about the "hole in her", about betrayal and anger. The more lyrical songs are incredibly painful to listen to, it is like hearing a song across a vast divide or chasm. I picture this lost girl trying to reach out to people but constantly thwarted by her own volatility and fury. And then she comes upstairs and asks me a question.
