In my party chairman's speech at the 2005 Conservative conference I delivered some unwelcome messages. I said that the party needed to change; that we didn't have a vision that resonated with the British people; that we were too unrepresentative; and that the public had stopped listening to what we had to say. Five years later, with a courageous and visionary leader, we've done it. We've changed, made ourselves a party in tune with contemporary Britain, and a party fit for government.
