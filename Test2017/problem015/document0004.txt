End-of-life care is the work of charities: from local, charity-run hospices; to at-home support delivered by different organisations according to where you live, from Macmillan nurses to Sue Ryder community-based clinical nurse specialists. In Mum's case, the hospice provided outreach palliative care. By all accounts, they do a fantastic job. Mum died so quickly – barely a month after her diagnosis – that we didn't have time to find out.
