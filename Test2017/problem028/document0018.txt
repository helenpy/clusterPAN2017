This battle will be won not in the newspapers, comments threads or posturings over awards. It will be won on the level of who is writing the best SF and fantasy. And the best writing this year came from all around the world, from women as much as men, and most of all from writers prepared to try to make it new. Itâ€™s not that SF is jettisoning its rich backlist, rather that the best writers are engaging with the traditions of genre in more thoughtful and open-minded ways.
