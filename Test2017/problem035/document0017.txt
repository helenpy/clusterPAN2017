Also out this month are Emily Woof’s The Lightning Tree (Faber), a somewhat different coming-of-age novel with its beginnings in 1980s Newcastle, Adam Thirlwell’s disquietingly riotous take on a crime caper, Lurid & Cute (Jonathan Cape), and The Offering (Sceptre), the third novel from the extraordinarily talented Grace McCleen. And fans of all things theatrical will not want to miss Anthony Quinn’s Curtain Call (Jonathan Cape), which plunges us into the stagedoor shenanigans of 1930s Soho.
