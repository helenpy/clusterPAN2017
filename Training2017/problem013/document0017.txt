As it develops, however, it moves in a far more interesting direction. The story of Marie’s lost daughter, which initially seems to be the driving force of the book, is shunted to the periphery. The drugs don’t develop into an addiction/recovery narrative; the promiscuity does not lead Marie either to a violent end or an epiphany. In fact, none of these apparent plotlines turns out to be a plotline. They are there for atmosphere: the book is about Marie’s job.
