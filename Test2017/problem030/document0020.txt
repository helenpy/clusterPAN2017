Get used to mysteries: water is dripping with them. It is, says Jha, “weird”. For a start, we still don’t know how it freezes. One of the major puzzles of this contrary substance – the fact that hot water freezes faster than cold water in sub-zero conditions – was discovered by a Tanzanian high‑school student named Erasto B Mpemba, who “found that hot ice-cream mix froze faster than colder mix in a classroom experiment”. This mysterious property is now known as the Mpemba effect.
