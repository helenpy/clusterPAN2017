Cards on the table: I used to smoke. At the height of my psychiatric career I smoked at least 20 a day, often more, as did virtually all my fellow patients, and staff. For the few non-smokers it must have been pretty well insufferable. At that time, you could smoke anywhere, except for a single "non-smoking" room, which nobody ever went into. Then you couldn't smoke anywhere except for a single "smoking" room, which was always crammed.
