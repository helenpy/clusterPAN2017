In the end the Germans never got near the Meuse, let alone Antwerp, and the battle was effectively over by Christmas Day, though it took another month of hard fighting to flatten the “bulge”. Both sides suffered about 80,000 casualties – only 20,000 more than the British army sustained in a single day’s fighting on the Somme in 1916 – though a further 30,000 civilians were killed and wounded.
