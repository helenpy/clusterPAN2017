Three-quarters think that people who go to A&E when they could be treated somewhere else should be required to go to a different health service instead, or that paramedics should treat patients at the scene whenever they can rather than taking them to hospital. Of course, they may mean that other people, rather than they, themselves, ought to be sent away if they wrongly present at A&E.
