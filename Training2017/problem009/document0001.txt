I believe we have shown we want to build a country that lives within its means but which has a world-class healthcare system; state schools that can compete with the private sector; and an international aid programme that helps those who most need it around the world. However, with a fiscal deficit looming large, I can understand why people question whether these are still our priorities, and whether we can still afford them in the face of necessary cuts.
