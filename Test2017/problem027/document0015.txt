Graham Swift ’s Mothering Sunday (Scribner, February), is brief, chapterless and very good – a novel of love and loss written in controlled and lapidary prose. There’s also Howard Jacobson’s retelling of The Merchant of Venice to look forward to: Shylock Is My Name (Vintage) is the next in a series begun with Jeanette Winterson’s flawed but fascinating rewriting of The Winter’s Tale – The Gap of Time.
