Rick Edwards, the host of BBC3’s debate programme Free Speech, has a simple answer: young people need to vote. Every chapter of his book None of the Above ends with a simple entreaty to turn up at a polling station on 7 May. “If you care about punishing politicians for breaking promises – VOTE … If you think the war on drugs is failing, or that it just needs to be fought harder – VOTE … If you care about the people who live and work in our country – VOTE.”
