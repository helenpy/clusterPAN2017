Knausgaard’s desperation to emulate his literary heroes (“I had to be big. I had to be. If not, I might as well top myself”) forms the central narrative of My Struggle, which recounts the growth of the author’s mind, the childhood that shaped him, the obstacles, misadventures and breakthroughs, the agony and ecstasy of being Karl Ove. How he succeeds in making this so compelling over the course of 3,600 pages is a puzzle that critics and scholars find difficult to crack.
