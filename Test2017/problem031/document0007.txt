Presumptuously, I’d suggest a new project for Morgan: a “year of reading canonically”. Her vim and wit would be ideally suited to a year reading or rereading Homer, Virgil, Chaucer, Shakespeare, Goethe, Pu Songling, Sterne, Hugo, Melville, Dostoyevsky, and on. Maybe even in different translations, where, when and if necessary.
