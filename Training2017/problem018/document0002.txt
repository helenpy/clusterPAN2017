Immediate freedom was not to come. Gorodetsky says the reasons are unclear, but it seems that Stalin’s former police chief Lavrenti Beria, who wanted to achieve an accommodation with the west after the dictator’s death, had wanted to replace foreign minister Molotov with Maisky. When the rival post-Stalin camp led by Khrushchev managed to oust Beria and had him put to death, Maisky was damned by association with Beria and released only in 1955.
