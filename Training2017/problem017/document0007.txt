Stephenson populates his space station with a lovable cast of determined, snappily talking geeks, the coolest of whom are women: Ivy, the unflappable station chief; Dinah, the robot expert; and Tekla, the sarcastic Russian cosmonaut. When Ivy is replaced by one Markus Leuker, the novel explains sardonically: “The choice was explained in terms of Markus’s dynamic leadership style, his charisma, and other such buzzwords that, as everyone understood, boiled down to the fact that he was a man.”
