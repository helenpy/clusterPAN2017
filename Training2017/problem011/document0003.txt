Frew intersperses the story with excerpts from Ishtar’s diary, which Silver finds years later. Ishtar’s essential selfishness, her immaturity, and her inability to take responsibility for her and her daughter’s life shine through. Silver is in awe of her mother’s beauty but that beauty underpins why Ishtar drifts from one inappropriate relationship to another, forcing Silver to the periphery of her young existence. Left to her own devices, even at 13, Silver is too self-sufficient a child.
