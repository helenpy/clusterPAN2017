So of course we are lonely. The longer we live, the fewer our peers. We lack connection, engagement, acknowledgment, because we are no longer useful â€“ or rather, we don't make ourselves useful. We have a reduced aptitude to contribute, to perform, to do. And that's life, for heaven's sake. We knew it was coming; we knew we'd get weaker, with less energy, less puff, less competence, and we also knew that with that decline in utility would come a decline in social access.
