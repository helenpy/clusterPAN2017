This story is followed by “The Buzzard’s Egg”, told in the quiet, rambling voice of an ignorant old slave who serves in a temple/prison for idols taken in war, like captured gods. He, their priest and jailer, is himself a prisoner. Alone, he talks to his latest god-prisoner. This one-sided conversation or confession or meditation is the whole story. I found it fascinating, full of suggestion and implication, and beautiful.
