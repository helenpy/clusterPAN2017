According to new findings from the charity Contact a Family, 70% of parents of disabled children say the stigma of claiming benefits for their children has increased in the last two years. And more than 10% say they have received verbal insults from friends or family for claiming benefits. That is worth repeating: needing state help for their disabled children is now reason for someoneâ€™s own family to turn against them.
