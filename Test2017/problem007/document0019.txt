Fortunately my organisation recognises the arbitrariness of such remits and so as much as possible we try to unbind ourselves from the red tape. I compromise with the social worker; I will meet Mrs Kelly at home on the day she is discharged and settle her back in. I will then take on the burden of trying to find free ongoing domestic support for her, so the social worker can close her case.
