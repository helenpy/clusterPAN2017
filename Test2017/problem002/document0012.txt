Here is one example of how the directive works. For the majority of contracts, we are allowed to "clarify" or check submissions with the companies or organisations that have bid for the contract, but this should only lead to a change in price if the bidders have misunderstood the brief or made genuine mistakes. Who can say if this delivers the value for money we would be able to achieve if we could openly negotiate with bidders?
