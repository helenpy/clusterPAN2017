Paul Burstow, then care services minister, organised for clear advice to be sent to NHS trusts. The advice duly appeared in the NHS chief executive's weekly bulletin. It said: "Insisting on sight of the Registrar's 'Green Form' to action the donation of a brain for research, or before releasing a body, is not a legal requirement, and can cause delays and distress to the bereaved â€¦ NHS chief executives will wish to consider how they support donation of brains for research."
