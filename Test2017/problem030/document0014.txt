Polly Samsonâ€™s second novel opens with a young woman on a windswept hillside. Julia is meeting her lover. On one hand, she wears a leather gauntlet; the hawk on her fist belongs to her brutish husband. As her lover kisses her, the bird flies, soaring into the air. It does not heed her as she tries to call it back. When it swoops in for the kill, the scream of the rabbit seems to go on for ever.
