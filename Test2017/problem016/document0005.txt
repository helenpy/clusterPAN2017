The driver of the car was my youngest daughter's boyfriend and he is waiting to hear if he will be taken to court. Every day we walk by the flowers left at the scene and the heartbreaking notes. And I mean heartbreaking. The note from his father tears you apart. His son was "the only thing I got right in life". In her more lucid moments my daughter says: "I hate walking by here, I think every time of Ian screaming for people to help his friend." She walks there every day. Several times.
