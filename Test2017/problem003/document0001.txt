Contract management skills need to be further developed in local government. We have some pockets of excellence, such as in Solihull where we have reduced the cost of the council's electrical repairs in the town hall, libraries and schools and colleges by 50% over five years. This has been achieved by co-locating staff and sharing information and communications technology systems and processes with the private provider of the services.
