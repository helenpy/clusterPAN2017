Finally, a book which shows that alcohol and laughter can make great bedfellows. Drinking For Chaps: How to Choose One’s Booze (Kye), by wine writer Olly Smith and the Chap magazine founder Gustav Temple, masquerades as an introduction to booze appreciation, but really it’s an excuse for some inspired silliness. Tackling such important issues as whether it’s ever acceptable to wear a fez while drinking cocktails, it’s best read when slightly drunk. I can offer no higher praise.
