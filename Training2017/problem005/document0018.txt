As someone who has always inclined towards reading the history book in preference to gazing into the crystal ball, I feel it is worth recalling that great statesman who split the political family and ended up as a Liberal Unionist. Several decades later and a similar trick was to lead to the emergence of the National Liberals and their subsequent assimilation within the Conservative fold. Can history repeat itself yet again?
