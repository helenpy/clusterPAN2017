Appalling as such behaviour is, causing unimaginable distress to those who knew and loved the deceased, as well as encouraging copycat deaths, those who goaded Dykes into jumping with shouts of “Go on – jump”, “Get on with it” and “How far can you bounce?” are to my mind almost as guilty as if they had physically pushed him off the car park. A review of the law is urgently needed if such behaviour does not currently constitute a serious criminal offence.
