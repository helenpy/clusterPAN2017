Career of Evil kicks off (sorry) with a woman’s severed leg. It is delivered in a package to Robin Ellacott, an amiable and efficient young woman who is the new-ish assistant of private detective Cormoran Strike. You’d think it would be difficult to work out who on earth would want to send you this kind of gift. But Strike can immediately think of four people in his past who could be responsible. That is a lot of people to know who would send you a severed limb. But he is that sort of man.
