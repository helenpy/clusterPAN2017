If you mention the word wine to most people, it will probably conjure up images of merriment: wining and dining, wine, women and song. Wine o’clock. For some reason that sense of fun rarely translates into books on wine. They tend to be as dry as chablis. That’s not to say wine enthusiasts don’t have a sense of humour – say “Carignan Camping” to one and he’ll be in stitches – but wine jokes do tend to be rather specialised.
