These subjects may seem ripped from the headlines, but they are not unusual for Enard, a French novelist whose work often focuses on war and political conflict. His first novel, La Perfection du Tir, from 2003, was told from the point of view of a sniper in a civil war, possibly the Lebanese civil war. The prizewinning Zone, first released in 2008, is a single-sentence story about a spy who wants to expose war crimes in several countries bordering the Mediterranean.
