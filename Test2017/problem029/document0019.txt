The story builds steadily to a vividly rendered apocalyptic scenario, and this proves to be the last showdown for several characters. The titular reference to “utopia” looks almost ironic in the face of this. The post-scarcity spaciousness of the series has an obvious utopian vibe, but this penultimate volume is haunted by very non-utopian concepts: the costs of things; the past’s inescapability; the encroaching end. We’re not there yet, but it won’t be long now.
