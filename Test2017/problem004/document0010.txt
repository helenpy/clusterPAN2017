Independent living has been one of the most positive and life-changing policies for disabled people in the last 30 years. We can't give up on it. It also helps the economy and fosters inclusive communities help disabled people to be part of the society they live in. The world is better if independent living is an integral part of it. How sad for everyone, not only disabled people, if future generations are denied it.
