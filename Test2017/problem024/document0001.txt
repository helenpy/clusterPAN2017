Pearl’s body has somehow fetched up in a swollen river among wet stones and rotting branches. Meanwhile, in Pearl’s dank house beyond the riverbank, her daughter Ada wanders dully from room to room, and her granddaughter Pepper fiddles with a camera that has no film. The ties binding these three lie tangled at the heart of a fine, strange novel about the pains of love between mothers and daughters.
