The brain bank's administrator advised that he was more likely to persuade another mortuary to do the job if we got Mum's death formally registered. That would provide us with the "green form" that some NHS trusts mistakenly believed was needed before a donation could take place. We secured an appointment at a nearby registrar's office, registered Mum's death and faxed the green form to the brain bank. The donation went ahead.
