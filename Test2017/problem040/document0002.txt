The title refers to Luisa Vertova Nicolson’s habitual interrogation of little Vanessa, just prior to producing some sweets or crayons as a bribe. Yet by the time she was 14 it is clear that Vanessa was often rather bad. She walks around Florence in bare feet, never gets the hang of contraception, takes overdoses and almost means it. Periodic crises ensue when Luisa, like a true archive hound, reads her daughter’s diaries and calls her a whore.
