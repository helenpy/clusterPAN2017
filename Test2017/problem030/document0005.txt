Involving and original, In My House is a book about betrayal and guilt; the smallness of our sins and the shattering enormity of their consequences. It is about the impossibility of walling ourselves off from human love, however determined the attempt. Hourston resolutely avoids the predictable, skilfully throwing the reader off-balance and creating a compelling sense of unease that shimmers unsettlingly beneath the ordinary lives she explores.
