As Campbell does not say, Blair’s behaviour since leaving office is a vital component of that failure. I am happy to accept that he is not simply money-grubbing, that he maintains a large payroll and seeks to do good, sometimes with shady people in shady places. The Times once grudgingly reported that he had made a £10m fortune but spent another £10m on his assorted foundations.
