This is the Whig version of history with a vengeance: an unabashed vision of then in terms of now, rather than then as the world must have seemed then. It is also science history without the science; more precisely, a series of tentative and piecemeal questions about the cosmos that ends with the arrival of something that a modern physicist would recognise as science. In those terms it is a history not of science, but of the questions from which modern science emerged.
