That all ancient historians, with the exception of Tacitus, believed that Nero was behind the fire that destroyed much of Rome does not mean we can say that Nero organised arson. The charges against him are not proved, a verdict that is “more than damning enough”, as Holland says. But that so many Romans thought Nero capable of torching Rome is a historical fact in itself. It wasn’t unreasonable to believe that an emperor, who had murdered his mother and wife, was capable of anything.
