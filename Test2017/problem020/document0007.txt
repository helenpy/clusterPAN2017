All this makes good sense: while we should never forget that whistleblowers are not always right, they deserve to be heard without threat of sanction. But we could do one more thing to encourage a climate of greater openness. The health authority that employed and sacked Pink may no longer exist, but its successor bodies do. How better could today's NHS demonstrate its newfound support for whistleblowing than by issuing a formal pardon to Mr Pink?
