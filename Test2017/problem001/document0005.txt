The funding for our community centre is based on the numbers of crumblies taking lunch. These numbers have fallen so there is every chance that the centre will be closed down. Madness. Lunches apart, the centre offers a daycare system for people with dementia as well as bingo, pedicure, advice clinics, geri-exercise, even baths and, when we crumblies are at home with our Ovaltine, there's other users: martial arts, weight-watchers, evangelicals.
