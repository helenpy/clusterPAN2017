So far, so conventional. Indeed, Robinson foregrounds the bare facts of this voyage by giving most of his narration over to the shipâ€™s central computer as it painstakingly works towards a de facto Turing test pass. This artificial mind is happy to provide great scads of data about every aspect of the ship. In the hands of another author it might amount to tedious specifying and dry-as-interstellar-dust worldbuilding, but Robinson makes it come thrillingly, grippingly alive.
