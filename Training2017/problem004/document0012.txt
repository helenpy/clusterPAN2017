The Data Protection Act seems to attract similar misrepresentation. Campaigners for the victims of press intrusion have the information commissioner in their sights. Rather than give the commissioner the credit for blowing the whistle on the unlawful trade in personal information back in 2006 (albeit the press and the politicians played on regardless), I am now accused by MP Denis MacShane of censorship (The New Review , last week).
