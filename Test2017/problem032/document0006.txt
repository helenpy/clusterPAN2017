There is a large cast of characters, all of them so gratifyingly what the reader would demand of a fantasy novel set between the wars in Norfolk that they seem almost familiar: the gruff housekeeper, the suspiciously elegant lady, the ancient aristocrat long since deprived of his marbles. Which is not to say that they are thin, or unsatisfactory: they are of the variety EM Forster called “easily recognised whenever they come in – recognised by the reader’s emotional eye”.
