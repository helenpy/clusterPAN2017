The potential disappointment is mitigated by the fact that, at the end of the first part, set in the very near future, nearly everyone is dead already. And by “everyone” I mean most of the human race. Up to this point, Seveneves has been a fascinating, breathtaking disaster novel that one-ups apocalyptic movies such as Armageddon or 2012 by subjecting humanity to an extinction-level event.
